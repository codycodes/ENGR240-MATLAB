% Linear algebra this week, functions on our next quiz on Thursday
% Uses for Linear Algebra
% You can find the point at which two lines intersect
% You can create circuits and test a bunch of stuff with calculations
% Linear variables; no powers other than 1, but you can do a lot of things
% linear algebra to figure things out about other powers
% Inverting is not a linear operation
% What's really important: A sub (i j) ROWS then COLS!
% % Not sure if this works, supposed to give dot product. See lecture 12
% for a working version.
% for i = 1:10
% p(i) = v(i) * w(i);
% p = p + p(i);
% end
% % Dot product of two vectors is commutative
% sum(v.*w)
% A * B = C, just works as multiplying two matrices in MATLAB
% Element-wise operation
% What we really want to do in this class is Matrix * vector operations
% Mainly square matrices by a vector, and we always do it by a column
% vector
% eye(3) - Identity matrix
% Inverting a matrix is computationally expensive
